	 * HEY!
	 * This class is just a spaceholder, as in here some events will be recoded and sent to the proxy.
	 * Resulting in a post on the discord guild designed for lotus gaming!
	 * Following Events will be posted (to be determined if an event will be added/removed)
	 * PlayerAdvancementDoneEvent, EntityDeathEvent, PlayerLevelChangeEvent, PlayerChangedWorldEvent
	 * Events like Join/Quit and Chat will be sent and taken directly from Proxy for less I/O across servers.
